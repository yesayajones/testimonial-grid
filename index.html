					I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
					looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
					amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
					found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
					weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
					completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as
					a Software Engineer at a VR startup.
